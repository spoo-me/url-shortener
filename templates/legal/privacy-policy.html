    <h2>Log Files</h2>

    <br>

    <p>Spoo.me follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites.
        The information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet 
        Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These 
        are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable except when you are logged in to your account. 
        The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on 
        the website, and gathering demographic information.</p>

    <p>When you visit a short URL on Spoo.me, we collect your IP address. For anonymous visitors, this data is 
        anonymized. For logged-in users, we may associate this data with your account to provide analytics for 
        your shortened URLs.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>

    <br>

    <p>Like any other website, Spoo.me uses 'cookies'. These cookies are used to store information including
        visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is 
        used to optimize the users' experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors' browser type 
        and/or other information.</p>

    <h3>Authentication Cookies</h3>

    <p>When you log in to your account, we use the following cookies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access Token:</strong> A short-lived cookie that maintains your logged-in session (typically expires after 15 minutes)</li>
        <li><strong>Refresh Token:</strong> A longer-lived cookie that allows automatic session renewal (typically expires after 7 days)</li>
        <li><strong>Session Cookie:</strong> Used to maintain your login state across page visits</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These cookies are essential for the authentication functionality and cannot be disabled if you wish to use 
        account features. You can delete these cookies by logging out or clearing your browser cookies, which will 
        sign you out of your account.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <br>

    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>

        <li><strong>Service Provision:</strong> To provide URL shortening services and API access</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To provide you with statistics about your shortened URLs</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send important service updates, security alerts, and email verification</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> To detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and unauthorized access</li>
